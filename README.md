# Revision Transformer

We propose Revision Transformer (RiT) to easily and interactively revise large-scale Transformer models in order to align them with human preferences in an online and democratic fashion.

Run `self.py` to generate answers with contextualized inputs. Check arguments for further adjustments. Use `process.py` to process moral norms data into the right file format and to pre-generate embeddings for comparison.
